# Implementing a classifier

Choose one of these two simple classifiers:

* [KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
* [Fisher's linear discriminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis#Fisher's_linear_discriminant)

Implement it from scratch in Python. Here "from scratch" means that you may use standard modules (that come with Python) and `numpy`, and nothing else.

Make a visualization using `matplotlib` showing the decision surface for your classifier with some test data. 

## Submission

* You may work in groups of up to 3.
* Submit on Sakai:
  1. your implementation code as one or more `.py` files
  2. an image (jpeg/png) of your classifier visualization
